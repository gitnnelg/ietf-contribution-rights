--- abstract

The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed
to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and
Internet communities while permitting the authors to retain as many
rights as possible.  This memo is an update to {{RFC5378}} and
retains the same consistent policies about intellectual property rights in Contributiions to the IETF
and contains the edits needed to recongize the IETF Intelectual Property Management Corporation
as the successor to the IETF Trust.  This memo updates {{RFC5378}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

a. "Contribution": any submission to the IETF intended by the
Contributor for publication as all or part of an Internet-Draft or RFC
(except for RFC Editor Contributions described in Section 4 below) and
any statement made within the context of an IETF activity.  Such
statements include oral statements in IETF sessions as well as written
and electronic communications, made at any time or place, that are
addressed to:

* the IETF plenary session,
* any IETF working group or portion thereof,
* any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session,
* the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG,
* the IAB, or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB,
* any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working
group or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF
auspices,
* the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function (except for RFC Editor
Contributions, as described in Section 4 below).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list, or other
function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity,
group, or function are not IETF Contributions in the context of this
document.

b. "Contributor": an individual submitting a Contribution.

c. "Indirect Contributor": any person who has materially or
substantially contributed to a Contribution without being personally
involved in its submission to the IETF.

d. "Copyright": the legal right granted to an author in a document
or other work of authorship under applicable law.  A "copyright" is not
equivalent to a "right to copy".  Rather a copyright encompasses all of
the exclusive rights that an author has in a work, such as the rights to
copy, publish, distribute and create derivative works of the work.  An
author often cedes these rights to his or her employer or other parties
as a condition of employment or compensation.

e. "IETF": in the context of this document, the IETF includes all
individuals who participate in meetings, working groups, mailing lists,
functions, and other activities that are organized or initiated by ISOC,
the IESG, or the IAB under the general designation of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), but solely to the extent of such
participation.

f. "IETF Documents": RFCs and Internet-Drafts that are used in the IETF
Standards Process as defined in 1(g).  This is identical to the "IETF
stream" defined in {{!RFC4844}}.

g. "IETF Standards Process": the activities undertaken by the IETF in
any of the settings described in 1(a) above.

h. "IETF Trust": a trust established under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, USA, in order to hold and administer intellectual property
rights for the benefit of the IETF.  The IETF Intellectual Property
Management Corporation replaced the IETF Trust in 2025 as the successor
organization.

i. "Internet-Draft": temporary documents used in the IETF Standards
Process.  Internet-Drafts are posted on the IETF web site by the IETF
Secretariat.  As noted in Section 2.2 of RFC 2026, Internet-Drafts have
a nominal maximum lifetime of six months in the IETF Secretariat's
public directory.

j. "Legend Instructions": the standardized text that is maintained
by the IETF Trust and is included in IETF Documents and the instructions
and requirements for including that standardized text in IETF
Documents.  The text and instructions are posted from time to time at http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.

k. "RFC": the publication series used by the IETF among others.  RFCs are published
by the RFC Editor.  Although RFCs may be superseded in whole or in part
by subsequent RFCs, the text of an RFC is not altered once published in
RFC form.  (See {{!RFC2026}} Section 2.1.)

l. "Reasonably and personally known": something an individual
knows personally or, because of the job the individual holds, would
reasonably be expected to know.  This wording is used to indicate that an
organization cannot purposely keep an individual in the dark about
certain information just to avoid the disclosure requirement.

m. "Non-IETF documents": Internet-Drafts that are submitted to the
RFC Editor independently of the IETF Standards Process.  (See Section
4.)

n. "IETF Intellectial Property Management": IETF IPM, the role of holding and
administering the intellectual property rights for the IETF.

o. "IETF Intellectual Property Managment Corporation": IETF IPMC, A Delaware corporation
established in 2023 as the legal entity supporting the IETF IPM role and the successor entity
to the IETF Trust.

# Introduction

In all matters of copyright and document procedures, the intent is to
benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting
the legitimate rights of others.

Under the laws of most countries and current international treaties (for
example the " Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Work" {{BERNE}}), authors obtain numerous rights in
the works they produce automatically upon producing them.  These rights
include copyrights, moral rights, and other rights.  In many cases, if the
author produces a work within the scope of his or her employment, most
of those rights are usually assigned to the employer, either by
operation of law or, in many cases, under contract.  (The Berne
Convention names some rights as "inalienable", which means that the
author retains them in all cases.)

In order for Contributions to be used within the IETF Standards Process,
including when they are published as Internet-Drafts or RFCs, certain
limited rights must be granted to the IETF Trust, which then grants the
necessary rights to the IETF.  In addition, Contributors must make
representations to the IETF Trust and the IETF regarding their ability
to grant these rights.

Section 1 provides definitions used in these policies.  Sections 3 and 4
of this document explain the rationale for these provisions.  Sections 1,
2, 5, and 6 of this document are normative, the other sections are
informative.  RFC 3979 {{BCP79}} {{RFC3979}} deals with rights,
including possible patent rights, in technologies developed or specified
as part of the IETF Standards Process.  This document is not intended to
address those issues.

This memo obsoletes RFCs {{RFC5378}}, {{RFC3978}} and {{RFC4748}} and, with RFC
3979 {{BCP79}} and {{RFC5377}}, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026
{{RFC2026}}.

This document is not intended as legal advice.  Readers are advised to
consult their own legal advisors if they would like a legal
interpretation of their rights or the rights of the IETF IPMC {{!RFC4371}}
in any Contributions they make.

##  No Retroactive Effect

This memo does not retroactively obtain additional rights from
Contributions that predate the date that the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation announces the
adoption of these procedures.

## IETF Trust Successor IETF Intellectual Propery Management Corporation

In 2025 the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IETF IPMC) replaced the
IETF Trust providing intellectual property management to the IETF.

The rights granted and held by the IETF Trust were assigned to the IETF IPMC.   Mentions
of the IETF Trust in this memo and prior versions should be understood to now refer to the IETF IPMC.

## Changes from RFC5378

This document does not change the IETF intellectual property rights from what is described in
{{RFC5378}} other than to update mentions of the IETF Trust with the IETF
Intellectual Property Management Corporation and references and links previously
to the IETF Trust website to the IETF IPMC website.

#  Exposition of Why These Procedures Are the Way They Are

##  Rights Granted in Contributions

The IETF IPMC and the IETF must obtain the right to publish an IETF
Contribution as an RFC or an Internet-Draft from the Contributors.

A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from the document
authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop and
publish IETF Documents and to use IETF Contributions in the IETF
Standards Process and potentially elsewhere.

The authors retain all other rights, but cannot withdraw the above
rights from the IETF IPMC and the IETF.

It is important to note that under this document, Contributors are
required to grant certain rights to the IETF IPMC (see Section 5.3.),
which holds all IETF-related intellectual property on behalf of the IETF
community.  The IETF IPMC will, in turn, grant a sublicense of these
rights to all IETF participants for use in the IETF Standards Process
(see Section 5.4.).
This sublicense is necessary for the standards
development work of the IETF to continue.  In addition, the IETF IPMC
may grant certain other sublicenses of the rights that it is granted
under this document.  In granting such other sublicenses, the IETF IPMC
will be guided and bound by documents such as {{RFC5377}}.

## Rights to Use Contributions

It is important that the IETF receive assurances from all Contributors
that they have the authority to grant the IETF the rights that they
claim to grant because, under the laws of most countries and applicable
international treaties, copyright rights come into existence when a work
of authorship is created (but see Section 3.5 below regarding public
domain documents), and the IETF cannot make use of IETF Contributions if
it does not have sufficient rights with respect to these copyright
rights.  The IETF and its participants would run a greater risk of
liability to the owners of these rights without this assurance.
To this end, the IETF asks Contributors to give the assurances in
Section 5.6 below.  These assurances are requested, however, only to the
extent of the Contributor's reasonable and personal knowledge.  (See
Section 1(l).)

## Right to Produce Derivative Works

The IETF needs to be able to evolve IETF Documents in response to
experience gained in the deployment of the technologies described in
such IETF Documents, to incorporate developments in research, and to
react to changing conditions on the Internet and other IP networks.  The
IETF may also decide to permit others to develop derivative works based
on Contributions.  In order to do this, the IETF must be able to produce
derivatives of its documents; thus, the IETF must obtain the right from
Contributors to produce derivative works.  Note that the right to
produce translations is required before any Contribution can be
published as an RFC, to ensure the widest possible distribution of the
material in RFCs.  The right to produce derivative works, in addition to
translations, is required for all IETF Standards Track documents and
for most IETF non-Standards Track documents.  There are two exceptions to
this requirement: documents describing proprietary technologies and
documents that are republications of the work of other standards
organizations.

The right to produce derivative works must be granted in order for an
IETF working group to accept a Contribution as a working group document
or otherwise work on it.  For non-working group Contributions where the
Contributor requests publication as a Standards Track RFC, the right to
produce derivative works must be granted before the IESG will issue an
IETF Last Call and, for most non-Standards Track, non-working group
Contributions, before the IESG will consider the Internet-Draft for
publication.  Occasionally a Contributor may not want to grant
publication rights or the right to produce derivative works before
finding out if a Contribution has been accepted for development in the
IETF Standards Process.  In these cases, the Contributor may include a
limitation on the right to make derivative works in the form specified
in the Legend Instructions.  A working group can discuss the Contribution
with the aim to decide if it should become a working group document,
even though the right to produce derivative works or to publish the
Contribution as an RFC has not yet been granted.  However, if the
Contribution is accepted for development, the Contributor must resubmit
the Contribution without the limitation notices before a working group
can formally adopt the Contribution as a working group document.  The
IETF Trust may establish different policies for granting sublicenses
with respect to different types of Contributions and content within
Contributions (such as executable code versus descriptive text or
references to third-party materials).  The IETF Trust's policies
concerning the granting of sublicenses to make derivative works will be
guided by RFC {{RFC5377}}.

The IETF has historically encouraged organizations to publish details of
their technologies, even when the technologies are proprietary,
because understanding how existing technology is being used helps when
developing new technology.  But organizations that publish information
about proprietary technologies are frequently not willing to have the
IETF produce revisions of the technologies and then possibly claim that
the IETF version is the "new version" of the organization's technology.
Organizations that feel this way can specify that a Contribution be
published with the other rights granted under this document but may
withhold the right to produce derivative works other than translations.

In addition, IETF Documents frequently make normative references to
standards or recommendations developed by other standards organizations.
Since the publications of some standards organizations are not public
documents, it can be quite helpful to the IETF to republish, with the
permission of the other standards organization, some of these documents
as RFCs so that the IETF community can have open access to them to
better understand what they are referring to.  In these cases, the RFCs
can be published without the right for the IETF to produce derivative
works.  In both of the above cases, in which the production of derivative works
is excluded, the Contributor must include a special legend in the
Contribution, as specified in the Legend Instructions, in order to
notify IETF participants about this restriction.

##  Rights to Use Trademarks

Contributors may wish to seek trademark or service mark protection on
any terms that are coined or used in their Contributions.  The IETF makes
no judgment about the validity of any such trademark rights.  However,
the IETF requires each Contributor, under the licenses described in
Section 5.3 below, to grant the IETF IPMC a perpetual license to use
any such trademarks or service marks solely in exercising rights to
reproduce, publish, discuss, and modify the IETF Contribution.  This
license does not authorize the IETF or others to use any trademark or
service mark in connection with any product or service offering.

##  Contributions Not Subject to Copyright

Certain documents, including those produced by the U.S. government and
those which are in the public domain, may not be protected by the same
copyright and other legal rights as other documents.  Nevertheless, we
ask each Contributor to grant to the IETF the same rights he or she
would grant, and to make the same representations, as though the IETF
Contribution were protected by the same legal rights as other
documents, and as though the Contributor could be able to grant these rights.  We ask
for these grants and representations only to the extent that the
Contribution may be protected.  We believe they are necessary to
protect the ISOC, the IETF IPMC, the IETF, the IETF Standards
Process, and all IETF participants, and because
the IETF does not have the resources or wherewithal to make any
independent investigation as to the actual proprietary status of any
document submitted to it.

## Copyright in RFCs

As noted above, Contributors to the IETF (or their employers) retain
ownership of the copyright in their Contributions.  This includes
Internet-Drafts and all other Contributions made within the IETF
Standards Process (e.g., via e-mail, oral comment, and otherwise).
However, it is important that the IETF (through the IETF IPMC) own the
copyright in documents that are published as RFCs (other than
Informational RFCs and RFCs that are submitted as RFC Editor
Contributions).  Ownership of the copyright in an RFC does not diminish
the Contributors' rights in their underlying contributions, but it does
prevent anyone other than the IETF IPMC (and its licensees) from
republishing or modifying an RFC in RFC format.  In this respect,
Contributors are treated the same as anybody else: though they may
extract and republish their own Contributions without limitation, they
may not do so in the RFC format used by the IETF.  And while this
principle (which is included in Section 5.9 below) may appear to be new
to the IETF, it actually reflects historical practice and has been
observed for many years through the inclusion of an ISOC or IETF Trust
copyright notice on all RFC documents since the publication of {{RFC2026}}.

## Non-IETF Documents

This document only relates to Contributions made as part of the IETF
Processes.  Other documents that are referred to as Internet-Drafts
and RFCs may be submitted to and published by the RFC Editor
independently of the IETF Standards Process.  Such documents are not
covered by this document, unless the controlling entity for that
document stream, as described in {{RFC4844}} chooses to apply these
rules.  Non-IETF Contributions must be marked appropriately as
described in the Legend Instructions.  See the RFC Editor web page
for information about the policies concerning rights in RFC Editor
Documents; for other document streams, the controlling entity must be
contacted.  See Section 11 for a declaration from the IAB on this
matter.

# Rights in Contributions

## General Policy

By submission of a Contribution, each person actually submitting the
Contribution and each named co-Contributor is deemed to have read and
understood the rules and requirements set forth in this document.  Each
Contributor is deemed, by the act of submitting a Contribution, to enter
into a legally-binding agreement to comply with the terms and conditions
set forth in this document.

The Contributor is further deemed to have agreed that he/she has
obtained the necessary permissions to enter into such an agreement from
any party that the Contributor reasonably and personally knows may have
rights in the Contribution, including, but not limited to, the
Contributor's sponsor or employer.

No further acknowledgment, signature, or other action is required to
bind a Contributor to these terms and conditions.  The operation of the
IETF and the work conducted by its many participants is dependent on
such agreement by each Contributor, and each IETF participant expressly
relies on the agreement of each Contributor to the terms and conditions
set forth in this document.

##  Confidentiality Obligations

No information or document that is subject to any requirement of
confidentiality or any restriction on its dissemination may be submitted
as a Contribution or otherwise considered in any part of the IETF
Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any
confidentiality obligation with respect to any Contribution.  Each
Contributor agrees that any statement in a Contribution, whether
generated automatically or otherwise, that states or implies that the
Contribution is confidential or subject to any privilege, can be
disregarded for all purposes, and will be of no force or effect.

## Rights Granted by Contributors to the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation

To the extent that a Contribution or any portion thereof is protected by
copyright or other rights of authorship, the Contributor and each named
co-Contributor grant a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, world-wide, sublicensable right and license to the IETF
IPMC under all such copyrights and other rights in the Contribution:

a. to copy, publish, display, and distribute the Contribution, in whole
or in part,

b. to prepare translations of the Contribution into languages other
than English, in whole or in part, and to copy, publish, display, and
distribute such translations or portions thereof,

c. to modify or prepare derivative works (in addition to translations)
that are based on or incorporate all or part of the Contribution, and to
copy, publish, display, and distribute such derivative works, or
portions thereof unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained
in a Contribution (in the form specified by the Legend Instructions),
and

d. to reproduce any trademarks, service marks, or trade names which are
included in the Contribution solely in connection with the reproduction,
distribution, or publication of the Contribution and derivative works
thereof as permitted by this Section 5.3, provided that when reproducing
Contributions, trademark and service mark identifiers used in the
Contribution, including TM and (R), will be preserved.

## Sublicenses by the IETF IPMC

The IETF IPMC will sublicense the rights granted to it under Section
5.3 to all IETF participants for use within the IETF Standards Process.
This license is expressly granted under a license agreement issued by
the IETF Trust, which can be found at
http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.

This license is expressly granted under a license agreement issued by
the IETF IPMC and must contain a pointer to the full IETF IPMC
agreement.

In addition, the IETF IPMC may grant additional sublicenses of the
licenses granted to it hereunder.  In doing so, the IETF IPMC will
comply with the guidance provided under {{RFC5377}}.

## No Patent License

The licenses granted in Section 5.3 shall not be deemed to grant any
right under any patent, patent application, or other similar intellectual
property right disclosed by the Contributor under BCP 79 {{RFC3979}} or
otherwise.


##  Representations and Warranties

With respect to each Contribution, each Contributor represents that, to
the best of his or her knowledge and ability:

a. The Contribution properly acknowledges all Contributors, including
Indirect Contributors.

b. No information in the Contribution is confidential, and the IETF, IETF
Trust, IETF IPMC, ISOC, and its affiliated organizations may freely disclose any
information in the Contribution.

c. There are no limits to the Contributor's ability to make the grants,
acknowledgments, and agreements herein that are reasonably and personally
known to the Contributor.

d. The Contributor has not intentionally included in the Contribution
any material that is defamatory or untrue or which is illegal under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which the Contributor has his or her
principal place of business or residence.

e. All trademarks, trade names, service marks, and other proprietary
names used in the Contribution that are reasonably and personally known
to the Contributor are clearly designated as such where reasonable.

## No Duty to Publish

The Contributor, and each named co-Contributor, acknowledges that the
IETF has no duty to publish or otherwise use or disseminate any
Contribution.  The IETF reserves the right to withdraw or cease using any
Contribution that does not comply with the requirements of this Section
5.


## Trademarks

Contributors who claim trademark rights in terms used in their IETF
Contributions are requested to state specifically what conditions apply
to implementers of the technology relative to the use of such
trademarks.  Such statements should be submitted in the same way as is
done for other intellectual property claims.  (See {{RFC3979}} Section 6.)

## Copyright in RFCs

Subject to each Contributor's (or its sponsor's) ownership of its
underlying Contributions as described in Section 5.6 (which ownership is
qualified by the irrevocable licenses granted under Section 5.3), each
Contributor hereby acknowledges that the copyright in any RFC in which
such Contribution is included, other than an RFC that is an RFC Editor
Contribution, shall be owned by the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corportion.
Such Contributor shall be deemed to assign to the IETF IPMC such Contributor's copyright
interest in the collective work constituting
such RFC upon the
submission of such RFC for publication, and acknowledges that a
copyright notice acknowledging the IETF IPMC's ownership of the
copyright in such RFC will be included in the published RFC.

## Contributors' Retention of Rights

Although Contributors provide specific rights to the IETF, it is not
intended that this should deprive them of their right to exploit their
Contributions.  To underscore this principle, the IETF IPMC is
directed to issue a license or assurance to Contributors, which
confirms that they may each make use of their Contributions as
published in an RFC in any way they wish, subject only to the
restriction that no Contributor has the right to represent any
document as an RFC, or equivalent of an RFC, if it is not a full and
complete copy or translation of the published RFC.


# Legends, Notices and Other Standardized Text in IETF Documents

The IETF requires that certain standardized text be reproduced verbatim
in certain IETF Documents (including copies, derivative works, and
translations of IETF Documents).  Some of this standardized text may be
mandatory (e.g., copyright notices and disclaimers that must be included
in all RFCs) and some may be optional (e.g., limitations on the right to
make derivative works).  The text itself, as well as the rules that
explain when and how it must be used, is contained in the Legend
Instructions.  The Legend Instructions may be updated from time to time,
and the version of the standardized text that must be included in IETF
Documents is that which was posted in the Legend Instructions on the
date of publication.

The IETF reserves the right to refuse to publish Contributions that do
not include the legends and notices required by the Legend Instructions.

It is important to note that each Contributor grants the IETF IPMC
rights pursuant to this document and the policies described herein.  The
legends and notices included in certain written Contributions such as
Internet-Drafts do not themselves convey any rights.  They are simply
included to inform the reader (whether or not part of the IETF) about
certain legal rights and limitations associated with such documents.

It is also important to note that additional copyright notices are not
permitted in IETF Documents except in the case where such document is
the product of a joint development effort between the IETF and another
standards development organization or is a republication of
the work of another standards development organization.  Such exceptions
must be approved on an individual basis by the IAB.

# Changes since {{RFC5378}}

This document is largely a carry over of {{RFC5378}} with edits to replace mentions
of the IETF Trust with the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IETF IPMC)
and replace mentions of the IETF Trust website with the IETF IPMC website.


# Security Considerations

This memo relates to the IETF process, not any particular technology.
There are security considerations when adopting any technology, but
there are no known issues of security with IETF Contribution rights
policies.
